      This is a trial version with functions not completed (press [F] to open debug mode)<br> 
      This game controls by keyboard and mouse.<br>
      Rules: 
      <blockquote>
        0. Press [SPACE] to switch to next step. If in debug mode, press [>] and [<] to move forward and backward<br>
        1. In the first year (turn), every player assign one house two roads as launching territory.<br>
        2. Player could just click on the nodes or links on the map to enter building system.
        <blockquote>
          Except for the first building, every house or road need to be constucted beside previous buildings.<br>
          There must be at least one space between every two houses.<br>
          If the link or node has been occupied by other player, you can not build anything on them unless you destroy them with special card. (haven't code yet)<br>
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          When it's in debug mode (for no formal method of getting destory card), press [D] to open destory mode<br>
          You can select any building one the map to destory. You can also slide to change the type of destorying, for resource give back or not.
        </blockquote>
        3. From the second year (turn), each player need to give 2d6 in reality and type the result. ("1" to 1 & "+" to 12) This would judge the resource producing each time.<br>
        4. After dicing, player could choose to build more houses or roads if the resource is enough.<br>
        <blockquote>
          2 crop & 2 wood for house<br>
          1 wood & 1 iron for road<br>
          2 wood & 3 iron & 2 fuel for house upgrade
        </blockquote>
        5. Every player can exchange resource with other player or with central system at anytime.<br>
        <blockquote>
          Press [E] to open exchange mode.<br>
          If exchange with system, the rate is 4 deliver resource : 1 assigned resource.<br>
          If exchange with system and is currently in debug mode, there's no constrain (infinite resource).
        </blockquote>

        <blockquote>
          house = 1 pt / house Lv2 = 2 pt / most roads = 2 pt / most army = 2 pt (haven't code yet) / flourish card = 1 pt (haven't code yet)<br>
